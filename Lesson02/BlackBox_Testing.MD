# Blackbox Testing
- Blackbox testing is a software testing method that focuses on examining the functionality of an application without looking at its internal code and structure.

# TL;DR:
- The tester checks what the software does, and not how it does it.

# Advantages
- No need for programming knowledge
- Tests from the users perspective
- Helps identify functional errors, missing features or UI issues

# Disadvantages 
- Limited test coverage (can't see hidden or code errors)
- Can't determine where the bug is in the code
- May miss logical or performance issues in the system

# Common Types of Black-Box Testing:
- Functional Testing (checks features and operations)
- System Testing
- Acceptance Testing
- Regression Testing
- Smoke Testing

# Equivalence partioning
- Equivalence Partitioning is a black-box test design technique used to reduce the number of test cases by dividing input data into groups (partitions) that are expected to behave the same way.
- In other words â€” if one value in a partition works, all others in that group should also work.
